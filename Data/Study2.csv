I believe it’s more likely a third-variable problem with factors such as a much higher rate of single parenthood among African American communities leading to higher crime rates and thus higher incarceration rates.  Also politically I put “moderately conservative” however, I am conservative economically and socially liberal (libertarian)"

With the football team, the Redskins, I felt like the only unacceptable one was the guy who looked like he purposefully put on a bunch of tanning oil or something. The others where they were literally painted red were not  racist in any way because that is the football team's color. It would be no different than fans painting themselves blue. Another good example is a team like the Raiders which are black and white. It is ok for people to paint themselves in black and white in this case. That is not be considered blackface or ""whiteface"", and obviously there has not been any outrage over face paint at Raider's games because of this.  /  / I do agree that maybe the team names could be changed, especially in the case of the Redskins. Changing both names to something like ""The Natives"" would be less offensive. I do not think many of the pictures reflect badly on actual Native Americans either. My grandma was Native American and she could not care less, but that is only one example. I also think that people dressing up as a ""stereotypical native"" that is represented in media is not harmful to the image of Native Americans. In the case of dressing up for a game, I do not think dressing up as a stereotypical Native American is any worse than dressing up as a stereotypical Viking in the case of the Minnesota Vikings, or dressing as a cowboy for the Dallas Cowboys, or dressing as a patriot for the New England Patriots. As a Texan myself I don't think people dressing as stereotypical ""Cowboys from Texas"" is offensive, and as someone with close family who is Native American, I do not think putting feathers in your hair or wearing face paint/paint made to look like war paint is offensive, and neither did my grandma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,6,2,4,2,1,6,3,4,2,1,5,3,4,3,1,2,6,4,3,1,5,3,4,3,1,6,2,4,2,1,5,3,4,3,1,5,3,4,3,1,5,3,4,3,1,5,3,4,3,1,,,,,,,,,,11.151,75.135,81.367,10,5,4,5,1,2,5,5,5,2,5,35.275,69.803,71.467,11,1,29,32,71,23,20,68,71,50,9,29,9.749,29.068,32.461,5,2,2,2,2,2,4.169,61.065,64.754,10,4,2,1,2,2,3,3,3,7.694,41.279,51.182,5,6,1,2,3,5,1,,,,1,,,1,,,0,1,1,United States,0,Texas,17,1,1,1,,2,3,,4,19,1,,1,1,5,"Some of the questions with the slider were hard to answer because I do not have enough knowledge to give an accurate value for those questions. With some of the opportunity questions I was using the case of my grandma and my dad, however that is only one case and probably gives me bias. But in this instance, my dad grew up very poor with a very poor white father as well as very poor native mother. Additionally, both sides of his family were poor if you look further up in the lineage. I would say this is not because one sides was white while one side was native, but instead because of the area and which they lived and the opportunities available to them. I do not think race had any thing to do with it. In my dad's case, he was able to work himself out of the area and gain wealth because what I believe was hard work, not because he was half white.  / In terms of learning about Native American history, I did not only learn this around Thanksgiving time in elementary school, but throughout much of my Texas history and United States History courses in high school. In these classes and textbooks we learned about the cruelties and atrocities committed against Native Americans such as the Trail of Tears. Of course the Native Americans would fight back, whether it was against Americans or Spanish conquistadors. This history is unfortunate, however I strongly believe that the people of today should not be blamed for the actions of their ancestors. I do not think banning any team or organization from using any type of name based on some type of Native American culture or history should be allowed. It is an important part of history. The only ones that push the limits are names like ""The Redskins"" because that could be considered racist. However, names like ""The Chiefs"" in the case of Kansas City are completely fine. I can see why some of these names may not be politically correct nowadays, however I still do not think they are offensive or reflect badly on actual Native Americans. /  / "
